# Weather-Classification
Image2Weather dataset used and collected from website of National Chung Cheng University having five different weather conditions. The architectures used on this dataset are VGG16, InceptionV3, DenseNet and CNN, due to data imbalance in some of the classes Data Augmentation technique is applied and feature extraction is also applied to improve the validation accuracy. The open source library TensorFlow was used for the full production of the Deep Learning pipeline along with the Keras framework for the ease of task which was performed using Python. The outcome of the project stated that the pre-trained architectures with a relevant parameter configuration delivers better accuracy than the basic CNN architectures
